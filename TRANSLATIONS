General Info:
=============

Reportbug-NG uses QT's translation mechanism. The basic workflow is:
1. Generate/Update .ts files from the sources
2. Modify the .ts files (=> translate)
3. Generate .qm files from the .ts files

Step 1. is done by the programmer who modifies the code, not by the 
        translator
Step 2. is done by the translator
Step 3. is done automatically during the build process


Gettext to QT transition:
=========================

I moved the existing gettext tranlations (.po files) to QT's system. 
Unfortunately all translations where marked as "obsolete", so they are not
used. They live still in the .ts files though, so one can reuse them when 
working on the translation.


1. Generating a new .ts file:
=============================

Goto src/translations and do 

  make template

this will generate a template named xx_XX.ts. Rename this file according to
the translation you wish to create and edit this file with linguist or an
editor.


2. Updating existing Translations:
==================================

Just use linguist or an editor and modify the existing translation.


3. Refreshing the .ts files after changes in the source:
========================================================

This step is usually done by me (the guy who modifies the sources) and not
needed by translators:

Call

  make upgrade

this will look in the source files for modifikations and modifies the existing
.ts files. If strings where added in the source, the entries are added in the
.ts file, if strings where removed, they are marked as obsolete in the .ts.
